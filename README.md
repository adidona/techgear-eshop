## Project description
This is a web-based e-commerce platform for managing technology products, built using Flask, python and Amazon DynamoDB. The application allows users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, place orders and sumbit their review. Admin users can manage users, products, and orders through a dedicated admin panel.
